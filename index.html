      <p>
        I am currently training full-time to be a full-stack web developer. My areas of focus include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java, jQuery, Node.js, Responsive Design, Heroku, Git, User Authentication, React.js, MySQL, and MongoDB.
      </p>

      <p>
        From 2000-2010, I was an accomplished mainframe programmer. I was proficient in areas such as COBOL, VSAM and DB2. I have extensive experience with the full software development life cycle, having worked both independently and in teams on countless numerous projects and software releases.
      </p>

      <p>
        I helped run staffing agencies from 2010-2018, but the opportunity to return to the world of I.T. has proved to be irresistible. I believe the greatest part of my ability is my versatility, and I look forward to joining and establishing myself with a strong, forward looking company that will benefit from my drive and expertise.
